## I need help!

Let us help you! Come see Jesse, Matt, Nick, and the whole gang at the iOS Meetup on Wednesdays from 6:30-8:00 in ~~GDC 6.302~~ (The first 3 iOS Meetups will be held in an alternate room, which will be announced on Facebook).

## What should I do if I miss a workshop?

Not to worry! All the materials used in the workshop (Including the starting and ending state of whatever we worked on) are neatly organized in the folders in this repo. The READMEs in each folder will briefly describe what we did during the workshop so you can get a grasp of what was covered.
